# NodeSchool Wellington

Come learn JavaScript at NodeSchool Wellington!

(ﾉ´ヮ´)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧

This weekly Node.js night is for anyone who wants to learn or teach the art of JavaScript magic! It will be primarily self-directed, with available guidance from [our mystical mentors](https://github.com/nodeschool/wellington/blob/master/README.md#mentors). You should have basic computer skills, a computer that runs Linux or Mac OS X, and feel comfortable finding information on the internet. People from communities that have historically been excluded from tech are very much encouraged to join!

- If you're new to JavaScript, we recommend playing around with [jsforcats.com](http://jsforcats.com/). :3
- If you're new to Node.js, we recommend adventuring through the workshops at [nodeschool.io](http://nodeschool.io) to begin your mastery of base JavaScript magic spells.
- If you have a project to work on, cast your spells and see what mad science emerges!
- If you want something to do, find someone who wants help and share your magic.

The night is intended to be a low-stress environment to work together, get feedback on our projects, help each other get through difficult spots, and share tricks we learn. If at any point you feel lost, talk to one of [our mystical mentors](https://github.com/nodeschool/wellington/blob/master/README.md#mentors)

There are no fees for these sessions, but any koha to sponsor our event is greatly appreciated. ＼(＾▽＾)／
